# Earthquake Cross Section

### Introduction
Today we will return to looking at earthquakes from the subduction zone beneath southern Mexico that we examined using the IRIS Earthquake Browser. Here is a link to review a portion of those earthquakes.

I built a program to create a publication quality cross-section that shows depth versus horizontal distance. 


### Overview
![2020-08-03-135151_1024x768_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44382721/89211936-992b9a80-d590-11ea-8b40-d7340f18b6f5.png)

The created figure displays that the subducting plate occurs down to a depth of 200km. This allows us to see that more seismicity occurs above than below the subducting plate. We believe that this is because the overriding plate is colder, more brittle, and under more stress than the material beneath the subducting plate.
### Tech Stack

The tech stack I used included:

* **Python** included the 'pandas' module to make the cross-section plot
